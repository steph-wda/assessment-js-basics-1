// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration - 
// Implementation
// Maintain 


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This step is used to define and document requirements and get stakeholder approval. How the application should function, features that need to be included, potenital roadblocks, and needed resources should be idenitified."

const design ="This step is used to model how the application will work and aspects of the design. These aspects include user interface, programming, security, communications, architecture, and platforms. A prototype is created and programmers recieve feedback from stakeholders."

const testingAndIntegration = "System tests and integration testing happens in this step. The systems integration test function  is to ensure that the developed systems meet all the technical  requirements with the components and subsystems integrated. The system  test may require any number of additional tests depending on the scope and complexity of the requirements; examples include: security,  conformance, accessibility, performance, stress, compatibility, and  regression tests. "

const implementation = "This step is used to install the software in a production environment. The software should meet the requiremnets defined in the requiremnets gathering step and operates as described in the design step."

const maintain = "Developers will need to address requests for enhancemnets, bug fixes, and new features in this step. Could possibly kick another round of the SDLC. "
